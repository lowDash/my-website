    <h2>The San Remo</h2>
    <p>The building&#39;s architect, Emery Roth, took advantage of new zoning regulations to build the first of New York&#39;s twin towered apartment blocks. Each of San Remo&#39;s ten-story towers is topped with an English Baroque mansion in the manner of John Vanbrugh and capped with an homage to the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The Athenian monument was known to Roth from the reproduction that had featured in the World&#39;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893. Roth also designed The Beresford and other landmark apartment houses and office blocks in New York. Construction began in 1929, weeks before the market crash initiated the Great Depression. The San Remo&#39;s construction process took approximately two years.</p>
